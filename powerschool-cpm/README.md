# PowerSchool CPM Extension

A VS Code extension that provides seamless integration with PowerSchool's Custom Page Management system. This extension syncs your current workspace directory with PowerSchool's file structure, making development and management of custom pages easier.

## Features

- **Automatic Directory Sync**: Uses your current workspace folder for PowerSchool file synchronization
- **PowerSchool API Integration**: Uses PowerSchool's undocumented CPM API to fetch folder structures
- **File System Management**: Creates, updates, and removes local files/folders to match PowerSchool structure
- **Configuration Options**: Customizable server URL, sync depth, and auto-sync settings
- **User-Friendly Commands**: Easy-to-use commands accessible from the Command Palette

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.104.0 or higher
- Access to a PowerSchool instance with Custom Page Management enabled
- Network access to your PowerSchool server

## Setup

1. **Install the Extension**: Install this extension in VS Code
2. **Configure Environment Variables**: 
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the extension root directory
   - Add your PowerSchool configuration:
     ```
     PSTEST_URI=http://pstest.yourschool.org
     PSTEST_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
     PSTEST_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
     ```
3. **Open Workspace**: Open any folder in VS Code to use as your PowerSchool development workspace
4. **Sync**: The extension will automatically sync when opening the workspace, or run the sync command manually

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `powerschool-cpm.autoSync`: Enable/disable automatic sync when workspace opens (default: true)
* `powerschool-cpm.maxDepth`: Maximum folder depth to sync from PowerSchool (default: 5)

## Environment Configuration

The extension requires a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

* `PSTEST_URI`: PowerSchool server URL (e.g., http://pstest.yourschool.org)
* `PSTEST_CLIENT_ID`: PowerSchool OAuth client ID
* `PSTEST_CLIENT_SECRET`: PowerSchool OAuth client secret

## Commands

Access these commands via the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P):

* **PowerSchool CPM: Hello World** - Test command to verify extension is working
* **PowerSchool CPM: Sync with PowerSchool** - Manually trigger sync with PowerSchool

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: When VS Code opens a workspace, the extension uses the current folder as the working directory
2. **Environment Loading**: Loads PowerSchool configuration from `.env.local` file
3. **OAuth Authentication**: Authenticates with PowerSchool using client credentials flow
4. **API Call**: Fetches the folder tree structure from `/ws/cpm/tree` endpoint using Bearer token
5. **Comparison**: Compares remote structure with local directory
6. **Synchronization**: Creates/removes local files and folders to match PowerSchool

## PowerSchool API Integration

This extension uses PowerSchool's Custom Page Management API endpoints:

- `GET /ws/cpm/tree` - Retrieves folder/file structure
- `GET /ws/cpm/builtintext` - Gets file contents (future feature)
- Additional endpoints for full CRUD operations (planned)

## Directory Structure

```
your-workspace/          # Current workspace folder (synced with PowerSchool)
├── admin/               # Admin pages
├── guardian/            # Guardian portal pages  
├── student/             # Student portal pages
├── teacher/             # Teacher portal pages
├── ...                  # Other custom directories
└── .vscode/
    └── settings.json    # Workspace settings
```

## Known Issues

- **Environment Security**: Ensure `.env.local` is not committed to version control (add to .gitignore)
- **Binary Files**: Binary files are created as placeholder text files with metadata
- **SSL Certificates**: Self-signed certificates are accepted for development environments
- **Token Management**: OAuth tokens are automatically refreshed as needed

## Usage Example

1. Open any folder in VS Code as your workspace
2. Configure your PowerSchool server URL in settings
3. Click the PowerSchool icon in the activity bar to browse and sync files
4. Edit files locally, then publish them back to PowerSchool using the extension commands

## Future Features

- Direct file content synchronization
- Upload local changes to PowerSchool
- Real-time sync capabilities
- Better authentication handling
- Support for custom SSL certificates

## Development

This extension is built using:
- VS Code Extension API
- Node.js built-in modules (https, fs, path)
- PowerSchool Custom Page Management API
